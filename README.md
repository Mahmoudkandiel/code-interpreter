Code Interpreter Sandbox
Project Overview
The Code Interpreter Sandbox provides a secure and isolated environment for executing Python code within a Docker container. Users can submit Python scripts via an API, which are then executed inside the container. The environment is configured to automatically handle dependencies listed in requirements.txt, ensuring that all necessary libraries are installed before execution.
